            <ul>
                <li class="precaution">Maintain a distance from people who have a cough or cold.</li>
                <li class="precaution">Cover your cough and sneeze with a tissue and then dispose of the tissue. Use a face mask and gloves.</li>
                <li class="precaution">Do at least three long breathing sets every morning. Take a deep breath, hold for 10 seconds and exhale slowly. Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
                <li class="precaution">Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health facilities, in case people infected with COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants. Donâ€™t use masks with valves.</li>
                <li class="precaution">Maintain at least a 1-meter distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better.</li>
