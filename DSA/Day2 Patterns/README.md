# Day 2 – Pattern Problems

This folder contains **10 pattern problems** solved using Python with nested loops.

## Problems List

1. **Square Pattern** – Prints a n x n square of stars.
2. **Right-angled Triangle** – Prints a right triangle of stars.
3. **Inverted Right-angled Triangle** – Prints an inverted right triangle of stars.
4. **Number Triangle** – Prints increasing numbers in a triangle.
5. **Inverted Number Triangle** – Prints decreasing numbers in a triangle.
6. **Pyramid** – Prints a centered pyramid of stars.
7. **Inverted Pyramid** – Prints an upside-down pyramid of stars.
8. **Diamond** – Combines pyramid and inverted pyramid to form a diamond.
9. **Pascal’s Triangle** – Prints Pascal’s triangle using numbers.
10. **Alphabet Pyramid** – Prints a palindromic alphabet pyramid.

## ✅ Notes:
- Use `n` as input for dynamic patterns.
- Outer loop controls **rows**, inner loop controls **columns/elements**.
- For pyramids and diamonds, spaces are important for alignment.
- Dry-run on paper before coding for better understanding.
