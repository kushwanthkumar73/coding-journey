# Day 1 – Number Problems

This folder contains **7 number-related problems** solved using **Python/Java/JavaScript/C**.  
These problems help strengthen basic programming and logical thinking skills.

## Problems List

1. **Count Digits** – Count the number of digits in a given number.  
2. **Reverse a Number** – Reverse the digits of a given number.  
3. **Check Palindrome** – Check if a given number is a palindrome.  
4. **GCD or HCF** – Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) or Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers.  
5. **Armstrong Numbers** – Check if a number is an Armstrong number.  
6. **Print all Divisors** – Print all divisors of a given number.  
7. **Check for Prime** – Check if a number is a prime number.  

## ✅ Notes

- Each problem is solved with simple and clean logic.  
- Works with **dynamic input values** for flexibility.  
- Great practice for loops, conditions, and basic algorithms.  
- Dry-run on paper for better understanding before coding.
